// For this challenge, implement a functino which checks whether or not a string is a palindrome.

// A palindrome is a word, verse, or sentence (such as "Able was I ere I saw Elba") or a number (such as 1881) that reads the same backward or forward.
// Restrictions: Do not use string.reverse()

function palindrome(str) {
  // IMPLEMENT ME
}
