// Write a function to calculate the Fibonacci of n, where n is a number that is passed in.

// For example fib(4) would call Fibonacci of 4

// Fibonacci is defined as a sequence of numbers in which 1 appears twice as the first two numbers, and every subsequent number is the sum of two preceding numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ... and so on.

function fib(n) {
  // IMPLEMENT ME
}

module.exports = fib;
